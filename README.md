# Timber
It's a game that I made using SFML as I read a book about that library. The codes were just being copied from the book since I started learning usage of SFML recently. I'll update the code as I implement my own approach.

This version can be considered as a first-step into 2D Game Programming. So, this game is not bug-free.

The other branch, called "TheGameItself", does not contain source code. That brunch can be used to play w/o compiling.
