It a game made using SFML as I read a book about that library. The codes were just being copied from the book since I started learning usage of SFML. I'll update the code as I implement my own approach. This version is a first-step into 2D Game Programming.

The other branch, called "TheGameItself", does not contain source code. That brunch can be used to play w/o compiling.

Keeo in mind that this game is not bug-free.
